# [Kycol Js](https://kycol.kavenah.com/) 
Version: BETA 0.1.0

The library for controlling the characters that can be typed/displayed in HTML text fields.

The great advantage and differential of Kycol is that it only displays the characters
that are allowed in each text field, it does not deal with the complete validation of fields/forms,
but rather increases control over what the developer allows to be entered in each field.
